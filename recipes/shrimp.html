        <h2>Description</h2>
    
        <p>These savory-sweet shrimp skewers are easy to make and cook in just a few minutes. They are perfect for summer weeknights or weekend dinner parties. Prep the sauce ahead of time for an even faster dinner. I prefer to use jumbo shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), however use what you have on hand.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound jumbo shrimp</li>
            <li>Â½ fresh pineapple, cored and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>skewers</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Steps</h2>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and ginger in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately onto skewers and place on a platter.</li>
            <li>Arrange skewers on the hot grate. Grill 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until shrimp is opaque and cooked through. Turn grill to low heat and brush sauce on both sides of skewers. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with cilantro and sesame seeds.</li>       
        </ol>
